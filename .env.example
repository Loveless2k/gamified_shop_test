# ============================================
# HOW TO OBTAIN SHOPIFY CREDENTIALS
# ============================================
# Follow these steps to get your Shopify Storefront API credentials:
#
# 1. Log in to your Shopify Admin panel (https://[your-store].myshopify.com/admin)
#
# 2. Navigate to Settings > Apps and sales channels
#
# 3. Click "Develop apps" button
#    (If you don't see this option, you may need to enable custom app development:
#     Settings > Apps and sales channels > Develop apps > Allow custom app development)
#
# 4. Click "Create an app" and give it a name (e.g., "Storefront Integration")
#
# 5. Click on your newly created app, then click "Configure Storefront API scopes"
#
# 6. Select the following required scopes:
#    ‚úì unauthenticated_read_product_listings - Read product listings
#    ‚úì unauthenticated_write_checkouts - Create and modify checkouts
#    ‚úì unauthenticated_read_checkouts - Read checkout information
#    ‚úì unauthenticated_read_product_inventory - Read product inventory
#    ‚úì unauthenticated_read_product_tags - Read product tags
#
# 7. Click "Save" to save the scopes
#
# 8. Click "Install app" to install the app to your store
#
# 9. After installation, you'll see the API credentials:
#    - Copy the "Storefront API access token" to PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN above
#    - Your store domain is: [your-store-name].myshopify.com
#
# 10. Update the values above with your actual credentials
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# - Never commit your actual .env.local file to version control
# - The .env.local file is already in .gitignore
# - For production (Vercel), set these as Environment Variables in the Vercel dashboard
# - Treat your Storefront API token like a password - keep it secret!

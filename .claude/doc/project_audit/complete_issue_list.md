## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Blockers - Must Fix Immediately)

### C1: Project Infrastructure Missing
**Issue**: The entire SvelteKit project does not exist
**Impact**: Cannot develop, test, or deploy anything
**Details**:
- No `package.json` file
- No `src/` directory structure
- No SvelteKit configuration (`svelte.config.js`)
- No Vite configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- No TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- No dependencies installed (no `node_modules/`, no `yarn.lock`)

**Required Actions**:
1. Initialize SvelteKit project with `npm create svelte@latest`
2. Configure for SSG (Static Site Generation) as per CLAUDE.md requirements
3. Set up path aliases: `$lib/*`, `$components/*`, `$features/*`, `$services/*`
4. Install core dependencies: GSAP, Shopify Storefront API client
5. Configure Vitest for testing

---

### C2: No Git Repository
**Issue**: Project is not initialized as a git repository
**Impact**: Cannot track changes, violates version control requirements in CLAUDE.md
**Details**:
- Running `git status` returns: "fatal: not a git repository"
- CLAUDE.md explicitly requires: "Non-trivial edits must be tracked in git"

**Required Actions**:
1. Initialize git repository: `git init`
2. Create `.gitignore` file (node_modules, .env, build artifacts)
3. Create initial commit with current structure
4. Set up branch strategy (main/develop)

---

### C3: Environment Configuration Mismatch
**Issue**: `.env.example` contains wrong environment variables
**Impact**: Developers will configure wrong services, wasting time and potentially incurring costs
**Details**:
- Current `.env.example` has: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `MONGODB_URL`, `HF_API_TOKEN`
- CLAUDE.md specifies: `PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`, `PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`
- This suggests the .env.example is from a different project entirely

**Required Actions**:
1. Replace `.env.example` with correct Shopify configuration
2. Remove all OpenAI, MongoDB, and HuggingFace references
3. Add documentation for obtaining Shopify credentials

---

### C4: GitHub Actions Will Fail
**Issue**: CI/CD pipeline expects files that don't exist
**Impact**: All pushes will trigger failing builds, blocking PR merges
**Details**:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `yarn install` and `yarn test`
- No `package.json` exists, so `yarn install` will fail
- No tests exist, so `yarn test` will fail

**Required Actions**:
1. Update workflow to match actual project structure
2. Add build step (`yarn build`)
3. Add linting step (`yarn lint`)
4. Consider adding type-checking step

---
